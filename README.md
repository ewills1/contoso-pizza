# .NET Application: Build with C#

This project demonstrates a .NET application developed in **C#**, showcasing the skills and concepts learned during the **Microsoft Learn** course, *Build .NET applications with C#*. The application highlights the use of C# and .NET features to build modern, efficient, and scalable solutions.

---

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilizes C#â€™s robust OOP capabilities for better code organization and reusability.
- **.NET Framework**: Built using the .NET SDK, leveraging its libraries and tools for rapid development.
- **Interactive Application**: Implements key functionalities such as data processing, user input, and interactive outputs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular code structure designed for scalability and maintainability.

## What I Learned

1. **Core C# Programming Concepts**:
   - Variables, data types, and operators.
   - Control flow (loops, conditionals).
   - Error handling using `try-catch`.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
   - Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
   - Abstraction and interfaces for modular design.

3. **.NET Framework and SDK Usage**:
   - Creating projects using the `dotnet` CLI.
   - Managing dependencies with NuGet.
   - Debugging and testing .NET applications.

4. **Building Applications**:
   - Event-driven programming.
   - Integration of libraries and frameworks to add functionality.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have:

- **.NET SDK**: Version 6.0 or later (download from [Microsoft .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)).
- A code editor like **Visual Studio Code** or **Visual Studio**.

---

## Setup and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_folder>
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

---

## Example Usage

- Upon running, the application processes user input and executes predefined tasks. 
- The modular design allows easy customization to suit specific use cases.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Add Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests using the **xUnit** framework to ensure code reliability.
- **Database Integration**: Extend the project to include a database for persistent storage.
- **Web API**: Convert the application into a RESTful API using **ASP.NET Core**.
